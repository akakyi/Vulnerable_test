The vulnerability is that the actuator endpoints are not sufficiently protected and become accessible to many users,
including an attacker who will have access to monitor and even manage many aspects of the application.

An attacker can gain access to:
1) View all possible mappings, bins, applied migrations, system resources, etc.
2) Application management. An attacker will be able to delete user sessions or even completely stop the application.

Consequences of weak protection of actuators:
1) The receipt by the attacker of information for further attacks.
2) Loss of intermediate user data.
3) Unexpected stop of the entire application.
